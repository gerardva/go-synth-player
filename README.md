# Tabs player
This very simple WIP-script plays notes using the [github.com/200sc/klangsynthese](https://github.com/200sc/klangsynthese) synthesizer. It takes a string sequence with the notes and
duration. For an example see the `notes.txt` file.

### Usage example
- Teach ChatGPT the format
- Ask for a sequence, for example in a certain key
- Add the sequence to the `notes.txt` file
- Play!
